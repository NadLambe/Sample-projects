<p class="quote">Shush. I was being chased by a giant dinosaur, but I think I've managed to give it the slip. Oh, you've got a dinosaur too! No, not the hugging. I'm against the hugging. I just have one question… do you know how to fly this thing? Shut it, Hoodie! Sorry, I'm going to have to relieve you of your pet. Shut up, I was talking to the horse. Your hips are fine, you're built like a man! I'm Scottish. I can complain about things now. I can really complain about things now. Five foot one and crying - you never stood a chance.

<p>He was dead already, I'm saving us. Follow me, and run! Five foot one and crying - you never stood a chance. I am totally against bantering. No sir. Thirteen! No. That is not the question. That is not where we start. The Doctor. Nosey parker. When this is all over, you can find a shoulder to cry on. But for now, you need me. I've lived for over 2000 years and not all of them have been good. Be a pal and tell me, Am I a good man? These are attack eyebrows. You could take bottle tops off with these.

<p>Once upon a time. The end. Dad skills. That's a relief. I hate babysitters. The Doctor. Nosey parker. When this is all over, you can find a shoulder to cry on. But for now, you need me. Well, I would say that that person would be an egomaniac, need, game-player sort of person. It's all right up to the eyebrows. Then it goes haywire. Clara, I'm not your boyfriend. I never said it was your mistake. Big scarf, bow tie, big embarrassing. Shut up! Just shut up, shut up, shut up, shuttity up up up! He was dead already, I'm saving us. Follow me, and run!</p>

<p class="quote">Don't be lasagna. I don't know. But I'd probably blame the English. Soon, I expect. Or later. One of those. My carer. She cares so I don't have to. Shush. Old ladies die all the time. It's practically in the job description. Shut up! Just shut up, shut up, shut up, shuttity up up up! I just have one question… do you know how to fly this thing? I am totally against bantering. No sir. Thirteen! You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was.

<p>I'm Scottish. I can complain about things now. I can really complain about things now. Please just... just see me. Old ladies die all the time. It's practically in the job description. Well, I would say that that person would be an egomaniac, need, game-player sort of person. I've made many mistakes... and it's about time that I did something about that. Your hips are fine, you're built like a man! Don't be lasagna. I don't need a sword. Because I'm the Doctor ... and this is my spoon. It's all right up to the eyebrows. Then it goes haywire.

</p>

<p>I don't need a sword. Because I'm the Doctor ... and this is my spoon. These are attack eyebrows. You could take bottle tops off with these. He was dead already, I'm saving us. Follow me, and run! Are you taller? Why? Do you have to reach a high shelf? I've made many mistakes... and it's about time that I did something about that. Kidneys! I have kidneys. And I don't like the colour. Come on, Team Not Dead. </p>
